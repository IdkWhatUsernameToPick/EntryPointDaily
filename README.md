# EntryPointDaily
Checks for the daily challenge and asks if you want to play.

How-to:
1. Install Python.
2. Download Entry Point.py.
3. Type "pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml" in the command prompt (cmd).
4. Launch the program.
5. In case it doesn't work run it in the command prompt and look for any errors.

I **may** add a timer in the future as well as it automatically getting the new daily once it changes without having to close the process.

Thanks to annihilate2479 for optimizing the code more!
